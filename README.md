# GNN-Final-Project

## Introduction

Final project for the course Generative Neural Networks for the Sciences.

This project implements the paper "Learning to Induce Causal Structure" by [Ke et al. (2023)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hp_RwhKDJ5).

## Installation

Install the required packages on your (virtual) environment by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
